I built this project to prove I have a good understanding of Object-oriented programming and how class
templates work.<br>
I made a Multiset class template (Multisets are containers that store elements following a specific order,
and where multiple elements can have equivalent values), Multiset <class T>. In this project, I programmed:<br>
- Constructors without parameters, which initializes an empty multiset;<br>
- Constructors for copies and attribution;<br>
- The addition or the elimination of an element from the Multiset (delete the first apparition);<br>
- A function that returns how many times an element appears inside the Multiset;<br>
- A function that returns if an element is inside the Multiset;<br>
- A function that deletes a specific element from the Multiset;<br>
- A function that returns how many times an element appears inside the Multiset (distinct apparitions);<br>
- The conversion of the element's data type with the help of templates;<br>
- The overloading of the output operator;<br>
- I allocated the memory dynamically.<br></pre>
