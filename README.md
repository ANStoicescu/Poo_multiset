I built this project to prove I have a good understanding of Object-oriented programming and how class
templates work.
I made a Multiset class template (Multisets are containers that store elements following a specific order,
and where multiple elements can have equivalent values), Multiset <class T>. In this project, I programmed:
● Constructors without parameters, which initializes an empty multiset;
● Constructors for copies and attribution;
● The addition or the elimination of an element from the Multiset (delete the first apparition);
● A function that returns how many times an element appears inside the Multiset;
● A function that returns if an element is inside the Multiset;
● A function that deletes a specific element from the Multiset;
● A function that returns how many times an element appears inside the Multiset (distinct apparitions);
● The conversion of the element's data type with the help of templates;
● The overloading of the output operator;
● I allocated the memory dynamically.
